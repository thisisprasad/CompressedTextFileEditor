This is a text file editor which stores files in compressed format. Files such as '.txt', programming source code files are purely text files or any file with  text content can be used with this editor.
Front-end part of this application is built using C#-WPF.
For the back-end part, the compression routines are implemented in c++.

# This application uses Huffman-Coding algorithm with run-length encoding tecnhnique to compress text files.

The C++ functions were called directly from the C# code using 'Dynamic Link Library'(.dll) files.
